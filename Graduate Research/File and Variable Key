The contents in this folder are all from my Graduate Research. The file names can be a bit confusing if you are not familiar with meteorological variables. 
Q = Specific Humidity
T = Temperature
RH = Relative Humidity
Wind = Wind Field (vectors)
flttredone = this is the first and last day that heatwaves occur in a calendar year over a 20 year period.
frac = the fraction or ratio between two models, or between a dataset and model, or for heatwave events spanning many days (ex - a 4-day heatwave event to a 1-day event)
URSM20/21, and CRSM20/21 are Regional Spectral Models
ERA5 is a reanalysis dataset
